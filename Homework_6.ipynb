        "- Ohmic (Joule) heating due to ionic current in the electrolyte phase in the anode, cathode, and separator pores.\n",
        "- Heating due to interface reactions in the anode and cathode (chemical and electric energy components)\n",
        "- Conduction heat transfer between different components (anode, separator, cathode)\n",
        "- Convection heat transfer at the battery boundaries (anode surface and cathode surface)\n",
        "- Radiation heat transfer at the battery boundaries (anode surface and cathode surface)\n",

        "The needed parameters have all been added to the battery `input` file, and calculated as needed in the battery `init` file.  I suggest you read through these files to understand what these parameters represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have also done many of the preliminary calculations needed for your thermal model, in the `function` file.  What is left for you to do is to calculate the volumetric heat generation term, `Q_XX`, where `XX` represents a given phenomena from the bulleted list above.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the single particle model, we have only three nodes (anode, electrolyte separator, and cathode).  For our thermal model, the, we track a single temperature for each.\n",

        "You can go ahead and code all the `Q_XX` terms at one time, but we will add these phenomena one at a time, using a series of 'flags' that are set to either 0 or 1.  We will simulate a single charge curve at varying rates, to see the relative impact of each phenomenon, and how it depends on the charging rate of the battery.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that there is some internal inconsistency, here: Many of the phenomena above (such as ohmic losses in the electrodes and electrolyte) are not actually incorporated into our battery model (the electrolyte potential, for example, is assumed to be constant at zero).  We also have not incorporated any balance equations for species. For this reason, we will not pay any attention to the cell voltage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, note that _many_ of these properties will vary as a funciton of temperature, in ways that would most certainly impact our temperature evolution.  Our work here will serve as a suitable first approximation, though.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, FWIW, the included python files demonstrate some new tricks that you might find useful for your project, such as passing 'keywords' when you call a function, which are then passed to the `main` model function."
